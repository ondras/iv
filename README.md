This project explores features of current Chromium-based UI libraries, namely those of [nw.js](http://nwjs.io/) and [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/).

A sample native application -- a lightweight image viewer -- is implemented using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, leveraging APIs provided by these frameworks. The app can be run using either nw.js or Electron, as there is a very thin compatibility [facade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern) that allows writing cross-toolkit code.
